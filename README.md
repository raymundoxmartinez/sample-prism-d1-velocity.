# PRISM D1: Velocity — AI Development Lifecycle Workshop

> :warning: **Sample Project — Not Production-Ready**

> This project is provided as a sample and reference implementation only. It is not designed, tested, or hardened for production use. Use it as a starting point or learning resource, and perform your own security review, testing, and operational hardening before deploying to any production environment. See **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** for known gaps and production hardening guidance.

> Compress the idea-to-production loop with disciplined AI adoption.

Part of the PRISM Framework (Progressive Readiness Index for Scalable Maturity) — the D1 Velocity pillar focuses on AI-native software development lifecycle practices that are **measurable from Day 1**.

- **11 CloudWatch alarms** including security critical finding and remediation SLA

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Run the prism-cli command to verify and setup everything:

```bash
bash prism-cli.sh workshop verify-setup
```

Or install manually:

- AWS Account with Bedrock access (Claude models enabled)
- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Python 3.11+ (for Strands Agent)
- AWS CLI v2 and CDK v2 (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- Claude Code CLI configured for Bedrock (`export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`)
- Git 2.40+, jq, GitHub CLI

The setup script supports flags:
- `--skip-aws` — skip AWS credential and Bedrock checks (for offline prep)
- `--skip-kiro` — skip Kiro IDE check
- `--verify-only` — only verify, don't install anything

### Deploy the Metrics Platform

```bash
cd infra
npm install
npx cdk bootstrap   # First time only
npx cdk deploy --all
```

This deploys: EventBridge bus, 8 Lambda processors, DynamoDB tables (KMS-encrypted), 3 CloudWatch dashboards, 11 alarms, Bedrock Guardrails, model pricing table.

> **For Security Agent:** Add `--context enableSecurityAgent=true` or use `bash prism-cli.sh securityagent setup`. See the [Security Agent Setup Guide](bootstrapper/security-agent/SETUP-GUIDE.md).

### Assess a Customer

#### Web Assessment Tool (Recommended)

The prism-cli includes a local web interface for running the full assessment flow — scan, interview, and report generation — in a browser.

```bash
bash prism-cli.sh assessment web
# Opens http://localhost:3120
```

The web tool supports two workflows:

**Self-service (customer runs it themselves):**
1. Customer clones this repo and runs `bash prism-cli.sh assessment web`
2. Scans their own repository from the web UI
3. Exports the scan results as JSON and sends the file to you
4. Optionally completes the interview themselves and sends the final HTML report

**SA-led (you run it):**
1. Import the customer's scan JSON into the web UI (skip re-scanning)
2. Conduct the interview using the built-in guide with scoring rubrics
3. Generate the HTML report directly in the browser

**AI Agent interview:**
1. After scanning (or importing a scan), choose "AI Agent Interview" from the next steps
2. An AI agent conducts the 20-question interview conversationally, asks follow-up probes, and scores responses against the rubrics automatically
3. The agent uses context from prior answers to ask smarter questions and avoid repetition
4. When complete, generates the same assessment report as the manual flow

The AI agent requires **Amazon Bedrock access** — specifically the `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` model (Claude Sonnet 4.6 via cross-region inference). To set this up:
- Enable model access in the [Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess) (Anthropic → Claude Sonnet 4.6)
- Configure AWS credentials locally (`aws configure`, SSO, or environment variables)
- The agent validates Bedrock access on startup and shows setup instructions if anything is missing

The interview form includes the full question bank, scoring rubrics, and scanner-informed focus areas. Reports can be printed or saved as PDF from the browser.

#### Manual Assessment

For a CLI-only or fully manual workflow, run the [PRISM Assessment](assessment/README.md) to determine maturity level and onboarding track. See the [full methodology guide](assessment/ASSESSMENT-GUIDE.md) for scanner logic, interview rubrics, and scoring formulas.

### Run the Workshop

The workshop is hosted on AWS Workshop Studio: [PRISM D1: Velocity Workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/d0a8b037-dfe0-4023-9ce2-f5de32ee4c67/en-US)

### Run the Sample Agent (No AWS Required)

```bash
cd sample-app
npm install && npm run dev          # Start the task API

cd agent
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python scripts/run-demo.py --mock   # Run agent demo with mock model
```

### Adopt the Bootstrapper (Post-Workshop)

```bash
cd ~/your-repo

# Install git hooks (creates .prism/ config directory)
bash /path/to/prism-cli.sh bootstrapper install-git-hooks --team-id your-team

# Optional: set custom token/cost bounds (defaults: 1M tokens, $100/commit)
bash /path/to/prism-cli.sh bootstrapper install-git-hooks --team-id your-team --max-tokens 500000 --max-cost 50

# Choose a CLAUDE.md template for your team
cp /path/to/bootstrapper/claude-code/CLAUDE-backend-api.md ./CLAUDE.md
# Or: CLAUDE-frontend.md, CLAUDE-platform.md, CLAUDE-agent.md

# Add GitHub workflows
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp /path/to/bootstrapper/github-workflows/prism-ai-metrics.yml .github/workflows/
cp /path/to/bootstrapper/github-workflows/prism-eval-gate.yml .github/workflows/
